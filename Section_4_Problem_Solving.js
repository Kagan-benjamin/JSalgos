// Problem Solving

// 1. Understand the problem
// - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// - What are the expected solution outputs?
// - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (sometimes this isn't easy to see)
// - How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of a problem?

// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum

function sum(x, y){
    return x + y;
} 





// 2. Explore concrete examples
// 3. Break it down
// 4. Solve / simplify
// 5. Look back and refactor
