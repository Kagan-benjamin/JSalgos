// Problem Solving

// 1. Understand the problem
// - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// - What are the expected solution outputs?
// - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (sometimes this isn't easy to see)
// - How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of a problem?

// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum

function sum(x, y){
    return x + y;
} 


// 2. Explore concrete examples
// - Come up with concrete examples that help to understand the basic problem
// - Examples provide sanity checks that the eventual solution works
// - User stories / Unit tests
// - Start with SIMPLE examples (input + output)
// - Progress to more complex examples
// - Explore examples with empty inputs
// - Explore examples with invalid inputs

// Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character within

// charCount('aaaa') // {a: 4}
// charCount('hello') // {h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1}






// 3. Break it down
// 4. Solve / simplify
// 5. Look back and refactor
