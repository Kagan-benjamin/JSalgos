            // Big O of Elementary/Quadratic Sorting Algorithms //

// Algorithm: | Time (best): | Time (avg): | Time (worst): | Space complexity:
// Bubble Sort |    O(n)     |    O(n^2)   |     O(n^2)    |      O(1)
// Insertion Sort | O(n)     |    O(n^2)   |     O(n^2)    |      O(1)
// Selection Sort | O(n^2)   |    O(n^2)   |     O(n^2)    |      O(1)

// - Nearly sorted data: bubble sort + insertion short perform well. Selection suffers
// - Space complexity is typically constant. 
// - Maintenance of running sort: use Insertion Sort!

// .All 3 of these algorithms are roughly equivalent in the grand scheme, excepting 
// special cases. All have average time complexities that are quadratic. Excel with 
// small data sets. We can do better, but we need more complex algorithms.
